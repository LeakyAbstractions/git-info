# git-info

> Extract information from the GIT repository

This project adheres to [Pragmatic Versioning](https://pragver.github.io).


## Generate a header file with GIT info

**Git-info** consists in a shell script that generates a header file containing
repository info for your C programs.

The next macros will be defined:

- GIT_INFO_ORIGIN
- GIT_INFO_BRANCH
- GIT_INFO_HASH
- GIT_INFO_TAG
- GIT_INFO_SUBJECT
- GIT_INFO_BODY
- GIT_INFO_NOTES
- GIT_INFO_AUTHOR_NAME
- GIT_INFO_AUTHOR_EMAIL
- GIT_INFO_AUTHOR_TIMESTAMP
- GIT_INFO_AUTHOR_DATE1
- GIT_INFO_AUTHOR_DATE_RFC2822
- GIT_INFO_AUTHOR_DATE_ISO8601
- GIT_INFO_COMMITTER_NAME
- GIT_INFO_COMMITTER_EMAIL
- GIT_INFO_COMMITTER_TIMESTAMP
- GIT_INFO_COMMITTER_DATE
- GIT_INFO_COMMITTER_DATE_RFC2822
- GIT_INFO_COMMITTER_DATE_ISO8601


## Install

You can always run the script from a local directory, but if you prefer to
properly install it to your system, run:

```bash
$ autoreconf --install && ./configure && make install
```

And the generator script will be copied to `/usr/local/bin`.


## Usage

Run the script from a git repository to generate the header file:

```bash
$ generate-git-info
```

By default, the header file will be located at `./deps/git-info.h`. If you want
to create it at a different path, you can pass it as a parameter.

```bash
$ generate-git-info src/repo.h
```

Once the header file is generated, you can include it from your source code to
access the defined macros containing repository info:

```c
#ifndef GIT_INFO_H
#define GIT_INFO_H

/*
 * This file was auto-generated on: 2018-05-13T10:00+09:00
 * by: /usr/local/bin/generate-git-info
 * DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
 */

#define GIT_INFO_COMMITTER_DATE_ISO8601 "2018-05-13T17:27:21+09:00"

#endif
```


## Makefile

You should make your task depend on the generated header file, and then add a
rule to automatically generate it:

```Makefile
foobar: deps/git-info.h

deps/git-info.h:
	generate-git-info
```

You may also add the header file to the list of files to be cleaned, so that you
can re-generate it easily when you need to update the repository info.
